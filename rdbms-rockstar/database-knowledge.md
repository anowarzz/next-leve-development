## Understanding Data, Information and Database\*\*

**What is Database ?**

A database is a structured collection of related data that represents some real world entities and organized for efficient retrieval, storage and management

- Database logo mostly came from drum memory structure

**What is Data ?**

Data is facts that can be recorded in the form of

**What is Information ?**

Information is processed and organized data that provides meaningful context , insight or knowledge .

</br>

## What is DBMS and Why

DBMS ‚áí Database Management System

RDBMS ‚áí Relational Database Management System

**Cons of Storing Data Using File System**

- Unstructured Data, multiple formats(.txt.mp4 etc)
- Data redundancy
- Data Inconsistency
- No concurrency protocol
- Security Issue

## Different types of Database Model and Relational Model

**Database Model :**

- Hierarchical ‚áí Tree structure data store
- Network
- Relational
- Document
- Key Value

- **Complexity**

Navigational Complexity :

User had to navigate through a network pointers to access or modify data, making it less intuitive than relational database

- **Schema Definition**

Defining a schema definition in a Network model could be more complex compared to the relational model

and Updating the schema was more complex

- **Lack Of Standardization**

Unlike relational model it did not have any standard query language and any standard rules

#### Relational Databse

Relational Database Stores data in table format and key is used as unique identifier .

Creating relation between table and maintaining the relation all the process are predefined .

## What is Key and Super Key

A Key in a relational database is a field or combination of fields that uniquely identifies a record in a table .

**Type Of Keys**

**Super Key**

Super key is a Attribute or set of attribute by which we can identify each row uniquely.

- Could be a single attribute or a set of attributes
- Could have null values in the set
- It actually a superset

1. Candidate Key
2. Primary Key
3. Alternate Key
4. Composite Key
5. Foreign Key

</br>
## Candidate, Primary, Alternate and Composite Key

#### Candidate Key

- Super key whose proper subset is not a super key
- Also called Minimal Super Key
- Potential Primary Key : From the candidate keys, one is chosen as the primary key . However all candidate keys are potential choices for the primary key .

#### Primary Key

From the candidate keys , one key is chosen as the primary key for the table. The primary key is a specific candidate key that is selected as the main identifier of the records in that table

‚áí Should be **unique, not null and stable**

#### Alternate Key

‚áí Candidate Keys which were not chosen as primary key are the alternate key

#### Composite Key

‚áí Generally Composite Key means

A **composite key** refers to **two or more columns combined to uniquely identify a row** in a table

‚áí Composite Primary Key

A **composite key** is a primary key made up of two or more columns that together uniquely identify a row in a table.

</br>

## Explaining Foreign Keys

**Foreign key** is a column in one table that **links to the primary key of another table**, helping to **connect related data** between the two tables.

</br>

## Techniques to Design Database

**SDLC** stands for **Software Development Life Cycle**‚Äîit‚Äôs the process used to **plan, create, test, and deploy software** in a structured way.

#### üîÅ Main Steps of SDLC:

1. **Planning** ‚Äì Decide how the project will be done, including time and resources.
2. **Requirement Gathering & Analysis** ‚Äì Understand what the software needs to do.
3. **System Design** ‚Äì Create architecture and UI/UX design (blueprint of the system).

Database Design is done under this step

1. **Development (Implementation)** ‚Äì Actually write the code.
2. **Testing** ‚Äì Check for bugs and make sure everything works correctly.
3. **Deployment** ‚Äì Release the software to users.
4. **Maintenance** ‚Äì Fix bugs and make improvements after it's live.

#### SDLC METHODS

#### ‚úÖ **Top SDLC Methodologies**

1. **Agile** ‚Äì Emphasizes flexibility, iterative progress, and customer collaboration.
2. **Waterfall** ‚Äì A linear and sequential approach, best for projects with well-defined requirements.
3. **Scrum** ‚Äì An Agile framework focusing on fixed-length iterations called sprints.
4. **DevOps** ‚Äì Combines development and operations to enhance collaboration and automate processes.
5. **Lean** ‚Äì Focuses on minimizing waste and delivering value quickly.

#### Purpose of Database Design

Structure organization for efficient data management

**Database Design Techniques :**

1. Top Down =‚áí Start Design From zero
2. Bottom Top =‚áí Design On Existing System
3. Hybrid Approach ‚áí Combined Both

</br>

## Steps of Top-down Technique

**Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram**

An Entity Relationship Diagram is a visual representation used in database design to illustrate the relationship between entities . It Shows how different entities in a database relate to each other through various types of relationship like , one to one , one to many or many to many

#### Top Down Steps

- Determining Entities

1. Place, Person or thing
2. Properties Or Attributes
3. Unique Identity
4. SIngular Name
5. Should more than one content of data

- **Determining Attributes for each Entities**

1. Should be related to the entity
2. Should be atomic
3. Should have keys

- **Relationship among Entities**

</br>

## Relationship and Relationship Cardinality

1 to 1

1 to Many

Many to One

Many to Many

Relationships means : Connection between entity or tables

Relationship Cardinality in databases specifies how many instances of one entity are associated with how many instances of another entity
